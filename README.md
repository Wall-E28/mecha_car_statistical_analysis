# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to offer insights on the MechaCar's production to help the manufacturing team. In order to conduct this analysis, I am using two datsets containing information related to the miles per gallon and the suspension coils of the MechaCar. I am using the programming language R and its dplyr library to complete this analysis.
